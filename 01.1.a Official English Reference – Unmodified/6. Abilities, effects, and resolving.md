## 6.1. General

### 6.1.1.
An ability is any card text in the text box on a character, item, or location that can affect the game. An ability has one or more effects. An effect is the part of an ability or action that gets resolved. An ability is considered to be fully resolved if all of its effects have fully resolved. If an ability has an effect that has yet to fully resolve, such as one that didn’t happen or resolved with no effect, that ability isn’t fully resolved.

**Example:** Cursed Merfolk – Ursula’s Handiwork has an ability called Poor Souls that reads, “Whenever this character is challenged, each opponent chooses and discards a card.” The Poor Souls ability is a triggered ability. The effect of this ability is “each opponent chooses and discards a card.”

#### 6.1.1.1.
A card can have multiple abilities. These are normally separated by paragraph breaks as well as keywords or story names.

#### 6.1.1.2.
Abilities generate effects. Action cards don’t have abilities; they generate effects as they resolve.

**Example A:** Huey – Savvy Nephew has two abilities: a keyword ability and an ability with a story name. The first is Support, a keyword ability. The second is Three Nephews, a triggered ability. These abilities are separated on the card by a paragraph break.

**Example B:** Ring the Bell is an action that has the effect, “Banish chosen damaged character.” This effect happens as the action resolves.

---

### 6.1.2.
A card’s abilities and effects are made up of one or more sentences, separated by periods. Each sentence is a separate effect. A sentence can have more than one effect. When an ability or effect begins to resolve, follow the order the effects are written in. Once a card’s abilities and effects begin to resolve, all effects resolve as much as possible, even if part of the effect or effects can’t resolve for any reason. Some actions and abilities have more than one effect to resolve as separate sentences of the action or ability. These sentences resolve in the order they’re written, but all occur as part of the same resolution of the action or ability. To correctly resolve an ability’s effects, the entire context and structure of the ability should be considered.

---

### 6.1.3.
All choices for effects are made as the effect resolves. If resolving an effect allows a player to choose “up to” N of something, the player can’t pick the same choice for more than one iteration of N. If the resolving effect includes multiple instances of the word “choose” or “chosen,” then the same choice can be made for each instance. “Up to” includes 0 as a legal choice.

**Example A:** Painting the Roses Red is a song action that has the effect, “Up to 2 chosen characters get -1 {S} this turn. Draw a card.” The same character can’t be chosen twice. The card’s player could also choose 0 characters.

**Example B:** The Queen – Commanding Presence has an ability called Who Is the Fairest? that reads, “Whenever this character quests, chosen opposing character gets -4 {S} this turn and chosen character gets +4 {S} this turn.” The same character can be chosen for both the -4 {S} and the +4 {S} modifiers since the ability has two separate instances of the word “chosen.”

---

### 6.1.4.
If an effect contains the word “may,” the player whose ability generated the effect can choose whether they want it to happen as the effect resolves. If the player chooses not to have it happen, that effect resolves with no effect, and no part of the “you may” sentence is performed. If an ability or action has multiple effects separated by periods, and one of them contains the word “may,” the choice applies only to that specific effect; the others resolve as normal.

---

### 6.1.5.
Some effects are considered sequential effects. These effects require a player to make a decision or pay a cost in order to resolve them. These are normally written as “[A] to [B],” “[A] or [B],” or “[A]. If you do, [B].” Note that both [A] and [B] can have multiple parts.

#### 6.1.5.1.
If the effect is “[A] to [B]” or “[A]. If you do, [B],” [A] is required as a part of the resolving effect. [A] can include paying {I}, and that ink is paid as the effect is resolving. If [A] can’t be completely performed, the effect can’t continue in sequence.

#### 6.1.5.2.
If the effect is “[A] or [B],” the player is required to choose [A] or [B] as part of the resolving effect. If [A] can’t be chosen, then [B] has to be chosen, and vice versa.

**Example A:** “Banish chosen item of yours to deal 5 damage to chosen character.” If the player doesn’t have an item in play that they can banish for the sequential effect listed in the first part of the sentence [A], they can’t deal the 5 damage described in the second part of the sentence [B].

**Example B:** “Whenever this character quests, you may shuffle this card into your deck to draw 3 cards.” This triggered ability is added to the bag when the character quests. When the player resolves the ability from the bag, they can choose the sequential effect of shuffling the card into their deck [A]. If they do, they draw three cards from part [B]. If the player chooses not to do [A] or is unable to do part of [A] for any reason, they don’t draw three cards from part [B].

**Example C:** Megara – Captivating Cynic has an ability called Shady Deal that reads, “When you play this character, choose and discard a card or banish this character.” If the player doesn’t or can’t choose and discard a card, they must banish Megara.

**Example D:** Judy Hopps – Optimistic Officer has an ability called Don’t Call Me Cute that reads, “When you play this character, you may banish chosen item. If you do, its player draws a card.” If the player chooses not to banish a chosen item, its player doesn’t draw a card.

## 6.2. Triggered Abilities

### 6.2.1.
Triggered abilities occur when their trigger condition is met. They trigger only once per trigger condition met.

### 6.2.2.
Triggered effects start with “When,” “Whenever,” “The first time,” "The second time," “The next time,” “At the start of,” or “At the end of” and describe both the game state that causes the abilities to trigger and the effects of the abilities. The starting word or phrase and the condition are collectively known as the [Trigger Condition]. These effects are normally written as "[Trigger Condition], [Effect].”

### 6.2.3.
When an ability’s trigger condition is met, it’s added to the bag to be resolved as described in section 7.7, “Bag.”

### 6.2.4.
Some triggered abilities are written as “[Trigger Condition], if [Secondary Condition], [Effect].” Such an ability checks whether the secondary condition is true only when the effect resolves. If the condition is false, the ability resolves with no effect. If an ability has multiple “if [Secondary Conditions],” all of them are checked as the effect resolves.

**Example:** Stitch – Carefree Surfer has an ability called Ohana that reads, “When you play this character, if you have 2 or more other characters in play, you may draw 2 cards.” When the active player plays Stitch, the triggered ability is added to the bag. When chosen to resolve, the effect checks if the player has two or more characters in play. If they don’t, the triggered ability resolves with no effect.

### 6.2.5.
Some triggered abilities are written as, “[Trigger Condition], [Effect]. [Effect].” Both effects are linked to the trigger condition, but each effect is independent of the other.

**Example:** Scar – Vicious Cheater has an ability called Daddy Isn’t Here to Save You that reads, “During your turn, whenever this character banishes another character in a challenge, you may ready this character. He can’t quest for the rest of this turn.” Because the two effects are both linked to the trigger condition, if Scar doesn’t banish another character in a challenge, he can quest this turn as normal.

### 6.2.6.
Some triggered abilities are written as, “[Trigger Condition] and [Trigger Condition], [Effect].” These abilities function as two triggered abilities that are independent of each other, but both resolve for the same effect.

**Example:** John Silver – Alien Pirate has an ability called Pick Your Fights that reads, “When you play this character and whenever he quests, chosen opposing character gains Reckless during their next turn.” The triggered ability occurs when John Silver is played and also when the active player quests with this character. The triggered ability doesn’t require both trigger conditions to be true at the same time for it to occur, only one or the other.

### 6.2.7.
Some abilities and effects create a triggered ability that can occur only during a specific duration or when a specific condition is met at a particular moment later in the game. These are usually created as the result of resolving an action card.

#### 6.2.7.1. Floating Triggered Abilities
Triggered abilities generated to exist for a specified duration. These exist outside of the bag. Whenever the condition of the floating triggered ability is met, an instance of that triggered ability is added to the bag for resolution. Once that duration expires, the floating triggered ability ceases to exist.

**Example:** Steal from the Rich is an action that reads, “Whenever one of your characters quests this turn, each opponent loses 1 lore.” When Steal from the Rich resolves, it creates the floating triggered ability defined by the card. This exists for the rest of the turn. Whenever the player quests with one of their characters that turn, the condition of the floating triggered ability is met and an instance of that triggered ability is added to the bag to resolve. The floating triggered ability continues to exist outside of the bag until the end of the turn, when the specified duration in the condition expires.

#### 6.2.7.2. Delayed Triggered Abilities
Triggered abilities generated to resolve at a specific moment later in the game. This moment is specified in the condition of the delayed triggered ability. The ability exists outside of the bag until that condition is met. When the condition is met, the delayed triggered ability is added to the bag for resolution.

**Example:** Candy Drift is an action that reads, “Draw a card. Chosen character of yours gets +5 {S} this turn. At the end of your turn, banish them.” When the action resolves, it generates a delayed triggered ability: “At the end of your turn, banish them.” The triggered ability exists outside of the bag until the step of the End-of-Turn Phase where end-of-turn triggered abilities occur (see 3.4.1.1). At that point, the triggered ability is added to the bag and resolves.

## 6.3. Activated Abilities

### 6.3.1.
Activated abilities are abilities listed on a card in play that a player can choose to use during their Main Phase. They’re normally written as [Cost] — [Effect].

#### 6.3.1.1.
An activated ability with an {E} cost on a character can be used only if the character is dry. An activated ability without an {E} cost on a character can be used the turn the character is played.

#### 6.3.1.2.
An activated ability on an item or location can be used the turn the item or location is played.

### 6.3.2.
While there are no effects waiting to resolve and a character isn’t questing or in a challenge, the active player may use an activated ability on that character as a turn action (see 4.4).

### 6.3.3.
Triggered abilities that occur from activating an ability are added to the bag, but they won’t resolve until after the effect from the activated ability is resolved.

**Example:** A player has Fang Crossbow and Tinker Bell – Very Clever Fairy in play. Fang Crossbow has an ability called Stay Back! that reads, “{E}, Banish this item — Banish chosen Dragon character.” Tinker Bell has an ability called I Can Use That that reads, “Whenever one of your items is banished, you may put that card into your inkwell facedown and exerted.” If the player uses Fang Crossbow’s Stay Back! ability and banishes the item as part of paying the activated ability’s cost, Tinker Bell’s triggered ability is added to the bag but won’t resolve until the effect of Stay Back! has fully resolved.

## 6.4. Static Abilities

### 6.4.1.
Static abilities are effects that could alter characteristics of a card, game rule, or game state. These are continuously active for a specific length of time (usually a printed duration). A static ability that doesn’t specify a duration is continuously active for as long as the card generating the effect is in play.

**Example:** An ability that reads, “Your exerted characters gain Ward until the start of your next turn” is a static ability that specifies a duration. An ability that reads, “Your exerted characters gain Ward” is a static ability that lasts for as long as the card generating the static effect remains in play.

### 6.4.2.
Static abilities can come from two sources: a resolved effect or a card in play. Continuous static abilities and applied static abilities from a resolved effect generally have a duration. Continuous static abilities from cards in play generally don’t have a duration.

#### 6.4.2.1.
Continuous static abilities generated from resolved effects affect all cards in play that the ability can affect. These static abilities last for as long as their duration is active and are functional only during their existence. When the duration is over, the effect ceases to exist, and all affected cards lose the effect immediately. If a card that would be affected by a continuous static ability generated from a resolved effect is played after that ability has resolved, the card has that ability’s effect as it comes into play.

**Example:** Restoring Atlantis is an action with the effect, “Your characters can't be challenged until the start of your next turn.” When the effect resolves, a continuous static effect is generated and continues to apply to all characters it could apply to until the duration ends. If a character is played after the effect resolves, that character is also affected by this continuous static effect.

#### 6.4.2.2.
Applied static abilities generated from resolved effects affect only cards in play at the time the effect resolved. Cards that would be affected by the applied static ability but that entered play after the effect resolved aren’t affected. These kinds of effects normally apply an ability or modifier to the affected cards on resolution.

**Example:** Kida – Protector of Atlantis has an ability called Perhaps We Can Save Our Future that reads, “When you play this character, all characters get -3 {S} until the start of your next turn.” When the triggered ability resolves, a static ability is generated that gives all characters -3 {S} until the start of the next turn. Because the effect applies to characters as it resolves, a character played after the static ability was generated isn’t affected by the static ability.

#### 6.4.2.3.
A continuous static ability generated from a card that’s in play affects all cards in play the ability can affect. These static abilities last for as long as the card generating them is in play. If a card generating a static ability leaves play, its effect ends as soon as the card is removed from the Play zone, and all affected cards lose the effect immediately. If a card that would be affected by a continuous static ability generated from a card in play is played after that ability has resolved, the card has that ability’s effect as it comes into play.

**Example:** A player has Weight Set and Grumpy – Bad-Tempered in play. Weight Set has an ability called Training that reads, “Whenever you play a character with 4 {S} or more, you may pay 1 {I} to draw a card.” Grumpy has an ability called There's Trouble A-Brewin' that reads, “Your other Seven Dwarfs characters get +1 {S}.” The player plays Happy – Good-Natured, which has 3 {S}. Happy comes into play with the static ability from Grumpy applying to him and has a {S} value of 4. Because Happy is played with 4 {S}, the triggered ability on Weight Set occurs.

### 6.4.3.
For some static abilities, determining whether their effect applies depends on checking to see if a condition within the text of the ability is true or false. These abilities are known as conditional static abilities. To determine if a conditional static ability is active, identify the word that ties the effect and the condition together, check to see whether that condition is true or false with regard to the game state, and decide if the effect applies based on the result of that check and the rules described in section 6.4.4.

### 6.4.4.
Conditional static abilities tie their condition and effect together with the word “unless” or the word “if.” Some conditions tied to their effects by the word “if” are part of a triggered ability and require a separate process to resolve (see 6.2.4).

#### 6.4.4.1.
Some conditional static abilities are written as “[Effect] unless [Condition].” For these abilities, while the checked condition is true, the effect doesn’t apply. While the checked condition is false, the effect applies.

#### 6.4.4.2.
Some conditional static abilities are written as “If [Condition], [Effect].” For these abilities, while the checked condition is true, the effect applies. While the checked condition is false, the effect doesn’t apply.

#### 6.4.4.3.
Some conditional static abilities are written as “[Effect] if [Condition].” For these abilities, while the checked condition is true, the effect applies. While the checked condition is false, the effect doesn’t apply.

**Example A:** Bashful – Hopeless Romantic has an ability called Oh, Gosh! that reads, “This character can’t quest unless you have another Seven Dwarfs character in play.” The effect, “This character can’t quest,” applies and remains active for as long as the condition, “you have another Seven Dwarfs character in play,” is false. Once the player has another Seven Dwarfs character in play, the condition is true, and the effect no longer applies.

**Example B:** Lefou – Opportunistic Flunky has an ability called I Learned from the Best that reads, “During your turn, you may play this character for free if an opposing character was banished in a challenge this turn.” During your turn, the effect “you may play this character for free” applies for as long as the condition “an opposing character was banished in a challenge this turn” is true. If an opposing character hasn’t been banished in a challenge during your turn, the condition is false, and the effect doesn’t apply.

### 6.4.5.
Effects that “skip” a step or phase of the game are static effects. “Skip [Step/Phase]” means, “This [Step/Phase] doesn’t happen.” If the effect skips a step or phase, no part of that step or phase happens. Any abilities or effects that would occur because of that step or phase don’t happen. If an effect would skip a step or phase but that step or phase has already started, then it’s not skipped and continues as normal.

**Example:** Arthur – Determined Squire has an ability called No More Books that reads, “Skip your turn’s Draw step.” If a player would start their Draw step with Arthur in play, they skip their Draw step and move immediately to the Main Phase of their turn. However, if a player finds a way to play Arthur during their Draw step, the current Draw step isn’t skipped and proceeds normally.

## 6.5. Replacement Effects

### 6.5.1.
Some effects are considered replacement effects. These effects wait for the stated condition to occur and then partially or completely replace the event as it resolves.

#### 6.5.1.1.
Abilities that include the word “instead” are the most common type of replacement effect.

**Example:**  
Stolen Scimitar’s ability *Slash* reads:  
“{E} — Chosen character gets +1 {S} this turn. If a character named Aladdin is chosen, he gets +2 {S} instead.”

---

### 6.5.2.
An event is the resolution of an effect as a whole. If an event contains multiple effects, all of those effects are considered to be part of the same event.

**Example:**  
*Let the Storm Rage On* is a song that reads:  
“Deal 2 damage to chosen character. Draw a card.”

While there are two effects in the action, the resolution of both effects is the event.  
If one effect is replaced, the event is partially replaced.  
If both effects are replaced, the event is completely replaced.

---

### 6.5.3.
For an event to be replaced, the replacement effect must exist and be able to apply to the event when it would happen.  
Replacement effects can’t replace an event that has already happened.

**Example:**  
*Snuggly Duckling – Disreputable Pub* has an ability called *Routine Ruckus* that reads:  
“Whenever a character with 3 {S} or more challenges another character while here, gain 1 lore. If the challenging character has 6 {S} or more, gain 3 lore instead.”

When a character challenges another character while at this location, the triggered ability is added to the bag and resolves.  
On resolution, the replacement condition “If the challenging character has 6 {S} or more” is checked to see if it’s met.  
If the stated condition isn’t met, the replacement effect doesn’t happen, even if the stated condition would be true later in the challenge.

---

### 6.5.4.
When an event is replaced, it never happens. Instead, a modified event occurs.  
This modified event may trigger abilities or be affected by other replacement effects.  
Because the first event is replaced, abilities that would have triggered from it don’t.

---

### 6.5.5.
A replacement effect only has one chance to partially or fully replace an event.  
Once a replacement effect is applied and a modified event occurs, that replacement effect can’t be applied to the same event again, even if the event is further modified and the replacement condition is met again.

---

### 6.5.6.
Some abilities have replacement effects that partially or completely replace their own ability.  
These are known as self-replacement effects and are always applied first.

---

### 6.5.7.
If multiple different replacement effects can apply to the same event, the player whose cards or card effects are being affected follows the steps listed here.

#### 6.5.7.1.
First, if any self-replacement effects can apply, choose one and proceed to section 6.5.7.2.  
If none can apply, proceed to the next step.

#### 6.5.7.2.
Second, if any other replacement effects can apply, choose one.

#### 6.5.7.3.
After the chosen replacement effect has been applied, a modified event occurs.  
Repeat this process, taking into account other replacement effects that can apply to the modified event, until no more replacement effects can apply.

**Example:**  
The active player has *Seven Dwarfs’ Mine* in play, and the opposing player has *Beast – Selfless Protector* and *Flounder – Voice of Reason* in play.

*Seven Dwarfs’ Mine* has the ability *Mountain Defense*:  
“During your turn, the first time you move a character here, you may deal 1 damage to chosen character. If the moved character is a Knight, deal 2 damage instead.”

*Beast – Selfless Protector* has the ability *Shield Another*:  
“If one of your other characters would be dealt damage, put that many damage counters on this character instead.”

The active player plays *Sleepy – Sluggish Knight* and moves him to *Seven Dwarfs’ Mine*.  
When the location’s triggered ability resolves, the active player chooses to deal damage to *Flounder*, creating the event:  
“Deal 1 damage to Flounder – Voice of Reason.”

Replacement effects from *Seven Dwarfs’ Mine* and *Beast* can apply.  
Because *Flounder* is being affected, the opposing player follows steps 6.5.7.1–6.5.7.3.

First, the Mine’s “deal 2 damage instead” is a self-replacement effect and is applied, resulting in:  
“Deal 2 damage to Flounder – Voice of Reason.”

Then, *Beast – Selfless Protector*’s replacement effect is applied, resulting in:  
“Put 2 damage counters on Beast – Selfless Protector.”

No further replacement effects can apply, so the event resolves.

---

### 6.5.8.
Two or more instances of the same replacement effect can’t apply to the same event.  
If multiple instances of the same replacement effect could apply to the same event, the player whose cards or card effects are being affected chooses one to apply.  
The rest cease to exist.

**Example:**  
The active player has *Rapunzel – Ready for Adventure*, *Flounder – Voice of Reason*, and two copies of *Heihei – Boat Snack* in play.

Rapunzel’s ability *Act of Kindness* reads:  
“Whenever one of your characters is chosen for Support, until the start of your next turn, the next time they would be dealt damage they take no damage instead.”

Each time Support is applied to *Flounder*, a new instance of the same replacement effect is created.

When *Flounder* would be dealt damage during a challenge, the player chooses one instance to apply.  
The event becomes:  
“The challenged opposing character deals no damage to Flounder.”

The remaining instance can’t apply and ceases to exist.

## 6.6. Ability Modifiers

### 6.6.1.
Some abilities and effects can modify a characteristic of a character or location in play, such as {S} or {L}.

#### 6.6.1.1.
A modifier applies to a card continuously, either for a fixed length of time or for as long as the card generating the modifier is in play.  
Whenever a modifier applies to a card’s characteristic, that characteristic changes immediately.  
This process doesn’t use the bag (see 7.7, “Bag”).

#### 6.6.1.2.
When multiple modifiers apply to a card’s characteristic, they don’t apply in any specific order but all combine to apply together.  
If a new modifier would apply to a card’s characteristic, it combines with all other modifiers that apply to it.

**Example A:**  
The active player plays *Grand Duke – Advisor to the King*.  
He has an ability called *Yes, Your Majesty* that reads,  
“Your Prince, Princess, King, and Queen characters get +1 {S}.”

The +1 {S} modifier generated by the ability’s effect applies immediately to the {S} of all characters the active player has in play with the Prince, Princess, King, and Queen classifications.  
If that player plays another character with one of these classifications while their Grand Duke is still in play, the new character enters play with the +1 {S} modifier applied and keeps that modification until the Grand Duke leaves play.

**Example B:**  
The active player has a *Heihei – Rambling Rooster* in play with 2 {S} and 2 {W}.  
Heihei gets +1 {S} from an effect.  
Heihei now has 3 {S} and 2 {W}.  
Later in the turn, an additional effect gives Heihei -5 {S}.  
Heihei’s {S} is modified to be -2 {S}.  
A later effect gives Heihei +1 {S}, bringing him to -1 {S}.  

Each time a modifier applies to Heihei, all other modifiers that apply to him combine with it at the same time.

---

### 6.6.2.
If a character has a negative {S}, it deals no damage during challenges and counts as having a Strength of 0 except for the purpose of applying modifiers to determine its {S} (see 6.6.1.2).

**Example:**  
The active player has a *Yokai – Scientific Supervillain* and a *Microbots* in play.  
Yokai has a triggered ability called *Technical Gain* that reads,  
“Whenever this character quests, draw a card for each opposing character with 0 {S}.”

Microbots has a triggered ability called *Inspired Tech* that reads,  
“When you play this item, chosen character gets -1 {S} this turn for each item named Microbots you have in play.”

The opponent has a character with 1 {S} and 1 {W} in play.  
The active player plays a second Microbots.  
When resolving the triggered ability, the active player chooses the opponent’s character, who immediately gets -2 {S} and now has -1 {S} and 1 {W}.  

The active player then quests with Yokai.  
Because the opposing character’s {S} is negative, they count as having a {S} of 0 when resolving Yokai’s triggered ability, and the active player draws 1 card.  
Even though the character’s {S} counts as 0 for the purpose of resolving Yokai’s effect, it isn’t changed to 0; they still have a {S} of -1.

---

### 6.6.3.
If a character or location has a negative Lore value {L}, it counts as having a Lore value of 0 except for the purpose of applying modifiers to determine its {L} (see 6.6.1.2).

**Example:**  
The active player has a *Flynn Rider – His Own Biggest Fan* in play, and their opponent has 5 cards in their hand.  
Flynn has 4 {L} and an ability called *One Last, Big Score* that reads,  
“This character gets -1 {L} for each card in your opponents’ hands.”

Because the opponent has 5 cards in their hand, a modifier of -5 applies to Flynn’s Lore value of 4.  
Flynn now has a new Lore value of -1.  

Because Flynn’s Lore value is negative, if the player exerts him to quest, Flynn counts as having a Lore value of 0 and the player gains 0 lore.  
This doesn’t change Flynn’s actual Lore value to 0.  
Flynn still has a Lore value of -1 until the number of cards in the opponent’s hand changes or another modifier is applied to his Lore value.

---

### 6.6.4.
If an effect says a characteristic “can’t be reduced below” a specified value, that characteristic’s value can’t be less than the specified value after modifiers to determine that characteristic’s value have been applied.

**Example:**  
The active player has an *Elisa Maza – Transformed Gargoyle* in play with 4 {S} and 4 {W}.  
She has a static ability called *Forever Strong* that reads,  
“Your characters’ {S} can’t be reduced below their printed value.”

Elisa gets -4 {S} until the end of her player’s turn from an effect.  
After modifiers are applied, Elisa has a {S} value of 0, but because that value is less than her printed value, her {S} is 4.

Later in the turn, Elisa gets +1 {S} until the end of her player’s turn from another effect.  
After both modifiers are applied, Elisa has a {S} value of 1, but because this modified {S} value is still lower than her printed value, her {S} is 4.

Later in the turn, Elisa gets +4 {S} until the end of her player’s turn from one last effect.  
After modifiers are applied, Elisa has a {S} value of 5.  
Since this modified {S} value isn’t lower than her printed {S} value of 4, Elisa has 5 {S}.

## 6.7. Resolving Cards and Effects

### 6.7.1.
To resolve a played card, the player takes the following actions immediately after the card is considered to have been “played” (see 4.3.3), dependent on the type of card being resolved.

#### 6.7.1.1.
If the card is a character, item, or location, it enters the Play zone (see 4.3.3.1).  
If a character is being played using its Shift ability, it must be put on top of the card indicated in section 8.10, “Shift.”

#### 6.7.1.2.
If the card is an action, it enters the Play zone, and its generated effect resolves immediately.  
Once the effect is completely resolved, the action is put into the player’s discard pile (see 4.3.3.2).

---

### 6.7.2.
To resolve an effect, the player takes the following steps, in order, while following all instructions in the resolving effect’s text and taking into account anything that could modify any step below during the process.

#### 6.7.2.1.
First, if an effect uses “for each” to define a single number, that number is counted as described in section 6.1.8.  
Then, if the effect includes a secondary “if” condition, check if the condition is true or false (see 6.2.4).  
If that condition is false, the effect resolves with no effect.  
Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

#### 6.7.2.2.
Second, check to see if any replacement effects would apply to the resolving effect (see section 6.5, “Replacement Effects”).  
These effects happen before the resolving effect’s instructions are followed.  
If there are multiple replacement effects that apply to the resolving effect, follow the rules in section 6.5.6.  
Once there are no replacement effects to apply, proceed to the next step.

#### 6.7.2.3.
Third, if the resolving effect deals damage to a character or location, calculate the total damage dealt by identifying the amount of damage dealt in the effect’s text and applying any damage modifiers to it.  
The resulting number is the final amount of damage dealt by the resolving effect.  
Then, proceed to the next step.  
If the resolving effect doesn’t deal damage, ignore this step and proceed to the next one.

#### 6.7.2.4.
Fourth, the player performs the instructions of the resolving effect’s text and makes any choices required by the effect in full and in the order written.  
If the effect tells the player to do something, the player does as much as possible, even if some part of that effect can’t be done.  
If the instructions include damage that was calculated in the previous step, all damage is dealt simultaneously.

### 6.7.3.
Triggered abilities that occur during the process of resolving a card or an effect are added to the bag, but these won’t resolve until after the card or the effect is resolved.  
If those triggered abilities occur during the process of resolving multiple effects from the same action or ability, they won’t resolve until all effects from the action or ability are resolved (see 6.1.2).

---

### 6.7.4.
A game state check occurs after every effect resolves (see 1.8.1).

---

### 6.7.5.
If multiple players would act at the same time because of a resolving effect, the active player performs their part of the effect first, then all other players do so in turn order (see 2.1.3).  
Each part is considered a part of the same resolution, and the effect isn’t fully resolved until all players have performed all instructions.

**Example:**  
*Donald Duck – Perfect Gentleman* has an ability called *Allow Me* that reads,  
“At the start of your turn, each player may draw a card.”

While the triggered ability is resolving, the active player resolves their part of the effect first and draws a card.  
Then, in turn order, each other player resolves their part of the effect and draws a card.  
Once all players have finished resolving their respective parts of the effect, the effect has fully resolved and the game continues.  
A game state check occurs only after the effect has fully resolved.

---

### 6.7.6.
If an ability or effect needs to reference a card’s characteristic from when it was in play but that card isn’t in play anymore, the ability or effect references the last known value for that characteristic from before the card left play.

---

### 6.7.7.
If an action or ability instructs a player to play a card as a part of resolving that action or ability, the card is played while the action or ability is resolving.  
Any effects that occur as a result of playing that card are generated or added to the bag, but they wait to resolve until the action or ability that instructed the player to play that card finishes resolving.  
This also applies to the effects of the card the player was instructed to play by the initial action or ability, even if that card is moved to a different zone.

**Example:**  
A player has a location named *Sleepy Hollow – The Bridge* in their discard pile and a *Jim Hawkins – Space Traveler* in play.  
Jim Hawkins has an ability called *Take the Helm* that reads,  
“Whenever you play a location, this character may move there for free.”

The player plays the action *Get to Safety!*, which reads,  
“Play a location with cost 3 or less from your discard for free.  
Then, if you have a location named Sleepy Hollow in play, draw a card.”

As the action’s effect resolves, the player plays Sleepy Hollow from their discard and puts it into play.  
Jim Hawkins’s triggered ability *Take the Helm* occurs and is added to the bag, but it doesn’t resolve yet.  
*Get to Safety!* continues resolving, and the player draws a card because Sleepy Hollow is now in play.  
After the action is finished resolving, the player can resolve triggered abilities like *Take the Helm* from the bag.

#### 6.7.7.1.
An effect generated from an action played this way resolves after the card that instructed the player to play the action finishes resolving but before any triggered abilities can be resolved from the bag.

---

### 6.7.8.
Some effects modify how a card enters play.  
These effects resolve along with the card being played.

**Example:**  
*Mother Gothel – Withered and Wicked* has an ability called *What Have You Done?!* that reads,  
“This character enters play with 3 damage.”

The effect resolves as Mother Gothel is put into play.  
There’s no moment within the game in which Mother Gothel enters play with no damage on her.
