# 1. CONCEPTS

## 1.1. General

**1.1.1.** The Disney Lorcana TCG is a game played with two or more players. Each player needs a deck of Disney Lorcana cards that they’ll use in the game (see 1.10, “Materials”).

**1.1.2.** Each player needs a way to track their lore totals and mark damage on characters and locations. This can be any method players find convenient that’s clear to all players in the game.

**1.1.3.** Disney Lorcana tournaments may have additional rules that can affect the ones in this document. Please refer to the Disney Lorcana TCG Tournament Rules found here for further reference.

**1.1.4.** Disney Lorcana cards are published in multiple languages. For the purposes of gameplay, the English cards, rules, rulings, and clarifications are the official versions.

**1.1.5.** Card text and rules may be updated. The most current updated information is the official version for gameplay.

**1.1.6.** Games with more than two players have additional rules that apply. See section 9, “Multiplayer” for more information.

**1.1.7.** Some cards include reminder text set in italics and within parentheses. Reminder text isn’t rules text. It’s only a memory aid and may vary without changing the meaning of the rules on any given card.

## 1.2. Golden Rules

**1.2.1.** If the text of a card contradicts a game rule, the card text supersedes that rule.

> **Example:**  
> Mufasa – Betrayed Leader has an ability called *The Sun Will Set* that reads, “When this character is banished, you may reveal the top card of your deck. If it’s a character card, you may play that character for free and they enter play exerted. Otherwise, put it on the top of your deck.”  
>
> The rule in section 4.3.2 specifies that cards can be played only during the active player’s turn. However, if an active player banishes an opponent’s Mufasa, the opponent can play a character even though it’s not their turn because the ability text allows the opponent to play it, superseding that rule.

**1.2.2.** If an effect prevents something from happening, that effect supersedes rules and other effects that allow it to happen.

> **Example:**  
> The opponent has a Tiana – Celebrating Princess in play. She has an ability called *What You Give Is What You Get* that reads, “While this character is exerted and you have no cards in your hand, opponents can’t play actions.”  
>
> The active player has a Genie – Powers Unleashed in play. He has an ability called *Phenomenal Cosmic Power!* that reads, “Whenever this character quests, you may play an action with cost 5 or less for free.”  
>
> If the active player quests with Genie, as long as the opponent’s Tiana is exerted and they have no cards in their hand, the active player can’t play actions even though Genie’s triggered ability allows it.

**1.2.3.** If an effect tells a player to do something, the player does as much as possible even if some part of that effect can’t be done. This is known as *doing as much as you can*.

> **Example:**  
> Reflection is a song action with an effect that reads, “Look at the top 3 cards of your deck. Put them back on the top of your deck in any order.”  
>
> If the player who plays this action has only 2 cards in their deck, they look at the top 2 cards and resolve the effect normally, doing as much as they can.

## 1.3. Players

**1.3.1.** Each person playing the game is referred to as a player. There must be at least two players in a game.

**1.3.2.** A player has at least one of three additional specific designations: active player, opponent (also known as opposing player), or teammate. A player’s designation can change during the game and they can have more than one at a time.

**1.3.3.** If a card’s effect refers to “you,” “your,” or “yours,” it refers to the player who played that card. If an effect refers to a specific player designation in its text, it means that player only. If an effect refers to a plural player designation, it refers to all players with that designation.

> **Example:**  
> Any reference to “teammates” refers to the teammates of the player who generated the effect.

### 1.3.4. Active player

**1.3.4.1.** There can be only one active player at a time. When a player starts their turn, they become the active player. When the next player in the game’s turn order begins their turn, they become the active player.

**1.3.4.2.** Active player is a designation that isn’t referenced in card text. The designation functions only to identify the player who’s currently taking their turn.

### 1.3.5. Opponent

**1.3.5.1.** Anyone a player is playing against is their opponent. In a multiplayer game, a player has multiple opponents.

**1.3.5.2.** Opponent is a designation that can be referenced in card text. If an effect references an “opponent,” it refers to any player other than the player who generated the effect, not including teammates.

**1.3.5.3.** The opponent designation can also be referenced in card text as “opposing player.”

### 1.3.6. Teammate

**1.3.6.1.** Some multiplayer game formats allow a player to designate one or more players as teammates. Such teammates are identified before the game starts. Teammates play together and aren’t opponents to one another.

**1.3.6.2.** Teammate is a designation that can be referenced in card text. If an effect references a “teammate,” it refers to any player who was designated as a teammate prior to the start of the game. A player can’t be their own teammate.

## 1.4. Cards

**1.4.1.** A Disney Lorcana deck is comprised entirely of standard Disney Lorcana cards and no other cards. A standard Disney Lorcana card measures 2.5" by 3.5" (6.3 cm x 8.8 cm). All standard Disney Lorcana cards have the Illuminary icon on the back. If anything refers to a “card” in the text, it’s referring to a standard Disney Lorcana card.

**1.4.2.** If a card doesn’t have the specific and exact Illuminary icon on the back defined in section 1.4.1, has an official but different illustration of the Illuminary icon (such as on the back of a card from a scenario deck in an Illumineer’s Quest), or is oversized, it’s not a standard Disney Lorcana card.

**1.4.2.1.** Specific types of cards have additional criteria that define them. For more information, see section 5, “Cards and Card Types.”

**1.4.3.** Cards a player includes in their deck are their cards. That player makes any decisions necessary for the card and its effects unless otherwise specified. If an effect's instructions include any physical manipulation of a card, the player whose deck the card came from physically manipulates it regardless of any other specification in the effect.

> **Example:**  
> Chernabog – Unnatural Force has the ability Dark Dance, which reads, “When you play this character, you may shuffle chosen opposing character into their player's deck. If you do, that player may play a character from their discard for free.”  
>
> When the active player resolves this triggered ability, they choose the character to be shuffled into the opposing player’s deck, but the opposing player physically shuffles the chosen character card into their deck.

**1.4.3.1.** If a card’s text refers to “you,” “your,” or “yours,” then it’s referring to the player who played the card. If an effect refers to “you,” “your,” or “yours,” then it’s referring to the player who generated that effect.

**1.4.3.2.** Player and character effects sometimes use pronouns to refer to the players and characters referenced in the effect in lieu of their names. Examples of these pronouns include: he, she, they, him, her, them, his, hers, and theirs. Item and location effects sometimes use pronouns in lieu of their names such as “it,” “its,” “them,” or “their.”

## 1.5. Costs

**1.5.1.** A cost is a payment that must be paid to play a card. The cost of a card is represented by a number in the top left corner of the card. This number equals the amount of ink necessary to pay for playing the card.

**1.5.2.** Some abilities have a cost. This cost must be paid in order to use the ability (see 4.4). Some costs are paid as part of resolving an effect.

**1.5.3.** A cost must be paid in full. If a card’s cost can’t be paid in its entirety, then the card can’t be played. Each payment applies to only one cost at a time.

**1.5.4.** A cost can’t be changed; however, the total amount paid can be affected. Adjustments to the total amount paid to play a card are called payment modifiers and affect only the amount paid to play a card, not the cost of the card itself.

**1.5.5.** Some cards have an alternate cost, which is a cost a player can pay instead of paying the normal ink cost of the card. A player chooses to pay an alternate cost during the process of playing a card.

**1.5.5.1.** Singing a song (see 5.4.4.2) is an alternate cost.  
**1.5.5.2.** Shifting a character (see 8.10) is an alternate cost.  
**1.5.5.3.** An ability or effect that allows a player to play a card “for free” is an alternate cost and means they may play that card without paying its cost (see 6.1.7).  
**1.5.5.4.** An ability or effect that allows a player to use an ability “for free” is an alternate cost and means they may use that ability without paying any costs except {E} (see 6.1.7.1).

---

## 1.6. Abilities

**1.6.1.** There are several kinds of abilities in the Disney Lorcana TCG. Abilities normally apply only when the source of that ability is in play. The source of an ability is normally the card or effect that generates it.

**1.6.1.1.** Triggered abilities continuously look for a specific condition and have an effect when that condition is met. Triggered abilities follow the rules in section 6.2.  
**1.6.1.2.** Activated abilities have a cost and an effect that occurs if that cost is paid. Activated abilities follow the rules in section 6.3.  
**1.6.1.3.** Static abilities are effects that are continuously active, either for a fixed length of time or for as long as the card generating the effect is in play. Static abilities follow the rules in section 6.4.  
**1.6.1.4.** Replacement effects are generated by some abilities. These replace one effect with another. Replacement effects follow the rules in section 6.5.  
**1.6.1.5.** Keywords are words or short phrases that represent distinct abilities. See section 8 for the full list of current keywords.

## 1.7. Game Actions, Timing, and Illegal Actions

**1.7.1.** When a player does something in game that’s part of a normal turn, such as draw a card, exert a character, declare a challenging character, etc., it’s a game action. A game action is singular. A group of game actions that achieves a specific outcome, such as the process of challenging, is known as a turn action.

**1.7.2.** Effects, turn actions (see section 4), and game actions (see 1.7.1) must fully resolve before the next effect, turn action, or game action can happen.

**1.7.3.** Choices made as part of resolving an effect, including those that reference “choose” or “chosen,” are made as the effect resolves (see 6.1.3).

**1.7.4.** Triggered abilities wait to resolve in an additional zone called the bag. The bag isn’t a physical zone, but a place where triggered abilities are held when their conditions are met. Players resolve the effects of their triggered abilities from the bag following the process described in section 7.7, “Bag.”

**1.7.5.** Characters can’t quest, challenge, or activate any abilities with {E} as a part of their cost unless the character has been in play since the beginning of their player’s turn. This is known as drying. A character becomes dry if they’re in play during the start of their player’s next turn (see 3.2.2.1).

**1.7.6.** If a player attempts a game action they couldn’t perform or begins a turn action they’re unable to complete fully, it’s an illegal action. When an illegal action occurs, the action is undone, meaning the player reverses all actions they took until the state of the game is returned to what it was before the illegal action or actions was performed, assuming the action is possible to reasonably undo (see 1.8.6.2). All payments are undone if applicable. Abilities that would have occurred because of the original action don’t happen.

**1.7.6.1.** The player may attempt to redo what was attempted but in the correct way.

**1.7.6.2.** A player may not undo any game actions that are impossible to fully undo, such as shuffling a deck or revealing a card. The player undoes as much as they can.

**1.7.7.** If an illegal choice was made as part of resolving an effect, the player undoes all operations back to the point that they made the original choice, where a new choice can be made. If no legal choices exist, then the effect resolves with no effect. If there are other effects to resolve that don’t involve the choice, then the player does as much as they can in resolving all effects.

> **Example A:**  
> A player attempts to play a character with a cost of 4 {I}. When they exert their ink to pay for playing the character, they realize they only have 3 unexerted cards (3 {I}) in their inkwell. Because the turn action for playing the character can’t be fully completed, it’s considered illegal. The player undoes their attempt to play the character, readies any ink that was exerted to play the character, and places the character back in their hand.

> **Example B:**  
> Let The Storm Rage On is a song with an effect that reads, “Deal 2 damage to chosen character. Draw a card.”  
> When a player plays this action and resolves the effect, they must choose a character. If they choose a character with Ward, a keyword ability that protects the character from being chosen, then the choice is considered illegal. The player undoes all actions to the point when the choice was made and must make a new choice. Note that the player doesn’t undo the playing of the action itself, as that part was performed legally. Only the illegal part of the game action, the choice, is undone and a new choice is made if able.

## 1.8. Game State Check

**1.8.1.** There is a set of conditions the game constantly checks for, and a result that occurs if the condition is met. The game checks for the listed conditions at the end of every step of the Start-of-Turn Phase, after the Challenge Declaration and Challenge Damage steps (see 4.6.4 through 4.6.6), after every turn action is completed, after any effect resolves, and when the turn ends. The following are the conditions and corresponding results:

**1.8.1.1.** If a player has 20 or more lore, that player wins the game.  
**1.8.1.2.** If a player’s turn ends with no cards in their deck, that player loses the game.  
**1.8.1.3.** In a multiplayer game, if a player is the last player remaining in the game, that player wins the game.  
**1.8.1.4.** If a character or location has damage equal to or greater than its Willpower {W}, that character or location is banished. A character or location banished as a result of taking damage from a character in a challenge since the last game state check or as a result of taking damage from a character’s ability since the last game state check is considered banished by that character.

**1.8.2.** Triggered abilities that occur as a result of a game state check are added to the bag when their condition is met but won’t resolve until after the game state check or checks are completed.

**1.8.3.** After a game state check is completed, the game state check immediately occurs again. If no conditions are met during a game state check, players then resolve any triggered abilities in the bag. Once all triggered abilities have been resolved from the bag and there are no further conditions met from a game state check, the game continues.

> **Example A:**  
> A player has a Flounder – Voice of Reason in play, a character with 2 {W}. Their opponent plays Fire the Cannons!, an action with an effect that reads, “Deal 2 damage to chosen character,” and chooses Flounder as the action’s effect resolves. Immediately after the action has finished resolving, a game state check occurs. Flounder has 2 damage counters on him and 2 {W}. Flounder has damage equal to or greater than his Willpower, meeting the condition in section 1.8.1.4 and is banished as a result. Another game state check occurs. No other conditions have been met, so the game continues.

> **Example B:**  
> A player has a Pride Lands – Pride Rock and a Flounder – Voice of Reason in play. Pride Lands has an ability We Are All Connected that reads, “Characters get +2 {W} while here.” Flounder has 2 damage counters on him and is also at the location, giving him a total of 4 {W}. The opponent has a Lumiere – Hotheaded Candelabra in play, a character with 7 {S}. During the opponent’s turn, Lumiere challenges Pride Lands, dealing 7 damage to the location. Once the challenge is over, a game state check occurs. Pride Lands has damage equal to or greater than its Willpower, meeting the condition in section 1.8.1.5 and is banished as a result. Once the first game state check is completed, another game state check occurs. Without Pride Lands in play, Flounder has damage equal to or greater than his Willpower, meeting the condition in section 1.8.1.4 and is banished as a result. Another game state check occurs. No other conditions have been met, so the game continues.

**1.8.4.** If multiple conditions are met by a player during a game state check, a single game state check occurs and all results occur simultaneously. If multiple conditions are met by multiple players during a game state check, a single game state check occurs and each player’s results occur in turn order.

---

## 1.9. Damage

**1.9.1.** Damage on a character or location is represented by damage counters. Each damage counter normally represents 1 damage; any damage counter intended to represent more than 1 damage counts as a separate damage counter for each 1 damage it represents. Damage can be dealt, put, removed, moved, or taken.

**1.9.1.1. Deal/Dealt** – Placing a number of damage counters on a character or location during a challenge (see 4.6) or as a result of resolving an effect that deals/dealt damage.  
**1.9.1.2. Put** – Placing a number of damage counters on a character or location as a result of an effect that puts damage on them.  
**1.9.1.3. Remove/Removed** – Taking a number of damage counters off a character or location as a result of an effect that removes/removed damage from them.  
**1.9.1.4. Move** – Taking off a number of damage counters from one character or location and placing them on another character or location as a result of an effect that moved damage to them.  
**1.9.1.5. Take** – A character or location takes damage whenever damage is dealt to, put on, or moved to that character or location.

**1.9.2.** Some card text refers to a character or location that “is damaged,” “was damaged,” “is dealt damage,” or “was dealt damaged.” These references mean the same as “takes damage” for cards printed with that text.

**1.9.3.** When a character or location with damage leaves play for any reason, all damage counters on that character or location cease to exist.

## 1.10. Materials

**1.10.1.** Each player needs to have a deck of Disney Lorcana cards to play with. A deck of Disney Lorcana cards must adhere to the construction requirements of the format being played, either Constructed or Limited. In Constructed, players use a previously constructed deck of Disney Lorcana cards. In Limited, players are provided a set number of unopened Disney Lorcana products to build a deck using the cards inside.

**1.10.1.1.** In the Constructed format, each player’s deck must contain at least 60 cards, can’t contain more than two ink types, can’t contain more than 4 cards with the same full name, and can’t contain any banned cards.

**1.10.1.2.** In the Limited format, each player’s deck must contain at least 35 cards for Draft or 40 cards for Sealed, may contain any number of ink types, and may contain any number of cards with the same full name.

**1.10.2.** Each player needs a method to track their lore totals. A player may use any reasonable method to do so that’s comfortable for and accessible to them. The lore-tracking method a player uses must always reflect the players current lore total during the game. Such methods can include, but aren’t limited to, pen and paper, lore trackers, and the Disney Lorcana Trading Card Game Companion app. Specific formats may identify what methods for tracking lore totals are allowed.

**1.10.3.** Each player needs a method to track damage counters on characters or locations. A player may use any reasonable method to do so that’s comfortable for and accessible to them. The damage-tracking method a player uses must clearly represent the amount of damage on each of their characters or locations to all players.

---

## 1.11. Lore

**1.11.1.** A player's lore total is the amount of lore they currently have in the game. A player’s lore total changes as they gain or lose lore. Each player starts the game with 0 lore and can’t have less than that. If a player would lose lore while they have 0 lore, they don’t lose any.

**1.11.2.** Some characters and locations have a Lore value represented by  ![[imagenes/lore.svg|20]] on the card. A questing character with a Lore value causes that player to gain the amount of lore represented by the character’s Lore value. If a questing character doesn’t have a Lore value or their Lore value has been reduced to 0, the player doesn’t gain any lore and their lore total doesn’t increase. A location with a Lore value causes that player to gain the amount of lore represented by the location’s Lore value at the start of that player’s turn (see 3.2.2).

**1.11.3.** If a player has 20 or more lore, they win the game (see 1.8.1.1).

---

## 1.12. Drawing

**1.12.1.** To draw a card, a player places the top card of their deck into their hand. A player can draw cards only from their own deck.

**1.12.2.** Cards are drawn one at a time. If an effect instructs a player to draw more than one card, they draw the number of individual cards in succession.

**1.12.3.** If an effect instructs a player to “put” a card into their hand, this isn’t considered “drawing” a card, even though the mechanics are similar.
