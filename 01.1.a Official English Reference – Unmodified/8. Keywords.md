### 8.1. General

#### 8.1.1.
Keywords are abilities or combinations of abilities represented by short names and provide those abilities to the card based on that name.  
Keywords are usually followed by reminder text describing what they do.  
This reminder text, enclosed in parentheses and set in italics, isn’t rules text but only a memory aid.  

The current list of keywords is:  
Alert, Bodyguard, Boost, Challenger, Evasive, Reckless, Resist, Rush, Shift, Singer, Sing Together, Support, Vanish, Ward.

#### 8.1.2.
Some abilities stack, or combine; these abilities are followed by “+[N].”  
A keyword ability that doesn’t have a +[N] doesn’t stack with other effects that provide that keyword.  
If a card with a keyword that doesn’t stack would get that same keyword from an ability or action, it won’t get that keyword.

**Example:**  
If you have a character with Support and an effect gives that character Support, only the first instance of the keyword applies.  
However, if the keywords were Resist +1 and Resist +2, the abilities would stack, and that character would have Resist +3.

### 8.2. Alert

#### 8.2.1.
The Alert keyword represents a static ability.  
Alert means “This character ignores the challenging restriction of Evasive.”

#### 8.2.2.
A character doesn’t gain Evasive from having the Alert keyword.  
They can still gain Evasive from another ability or effect.

---

### 8.3. Bodyguard

#### 8.3.1.
The Bodyguard keyword represents two abilities.

#### 8.3.2.
The first of these is a static ability that functions while the character is being played and creates a replacement effect.  
This ability means “This character may enter play with the exerted state rather than the ready state.”

#### 8.3.3.
The second is a static ability that creates a challenging restriction.  
This ability means “If an opponent would choose one of your characters to challenge, they must choose this character or another character with Bodyguard if able.”

---

### 8.4. Boost

#### 8.4.1.
The Boost keyword represents an activated ability with a specified duration.  
Boost N {I} means “Once during your turn, you may pay N {I} to put the top card of your deck facedown under this card.”

#### 8.4.2.
No player can look at the front of a card that has been put facedown under another card at any time, not even their own.

#### 8.4.3.
If a card is under another card, it’s not considered to be in play.  
Putting a card under another card with Boost doesn’t count as playing that card.

---

### 8.5. Challenger

#### 8.5.1.
The Challenger keyword represents a static ability that functions while a character is challenging.  
Challenger +N means “While this character is challenging, they gain +N {S}.”  
Because this is a +N ability, it stacks with other Challenger effects.

#### 8.5.2.
A character with Challenger doesn’t gain +N {S} if they’re being challenged.

---

### 8.6. Evasive

#### 8.6.1.
The Evasive keyword represents a static ability that creates a challenging restriction.  
Evasive means “This [Type] can’t be challenged except by a character with Evasive.”

---

### 8.7. Reckless

#### 8.7.1.
The Reckless keyword represents two static abilities.

#### 8.7.2.
The first ability means “This character can’t quest.”

#### 8.7.3.
The second ability means “You can’t declare the end of your turn if this character is ready and can challenge an opposing character or location.”

#### 8.7.4.
A player can still exert a character with Reckless to use abilities or sing songs if able.

---

### 8.8. Resist

#### 8.8.1.
The Resist keyword represents a static ability that modifies the amount of damage dealt to the card with the keyword.  
Resist +N means “Damage that would be dealt to this character or location is reduced by N.”  
Resist is a damage reduction (see 4.6.6.1).  
Because this is a +N ability, this stacks with other Resist effects.

#### 8.8.2.
If damage dealt to this character or location is reduced to 0, no damage is considered to have been dealt.

#### 8.8.3.
Damage put or moved onto a character with Resist isn’t affected by the ability.

---

### 8.9. Rush

#### 8.9.1.
The Rush keyword represents a static ability.  
Rush means “This character can challenge as though they were in play at the beginning of your turn.”

---

### 8.10. Shift

#### 8.10.1.
The Shift keyword represents a static ability of paying an alternate cost to play a character instead of paying the character’s ink cost.  
Shift means “If you have a character in play with the same name as this card, you may play this character by paying their Shift cost instead of their ink cost.  
If you do, put this card on top of another character you have in play with the same name.”  
This is called shifting.

#### 8.10.2.
If a shifted character is put on top of an exerted character, the shifted character enters play exerted.

#### 8.10.3.
If an effect on a shifted character causes it to enter play exerted, it becomes exerted as it enters play, even if the character it was on top of is ready.

#### 8.10.4.
If a shifted character is put on top of a dry character, the shifted character enters play dry.  
If a shifted character is put on top of a drying character, the shifted character enters play drying.

#### 8.10.5.
A player can use a shifted character to perform all turn actions of the character it was put on top of.  
The shifted character doesn’t gain the text of the character it’s put on top of, but it does keep any effects that apply to that character when the shifted character enters play.  
A player can exert a shifted character to sing a song if the character it was put on top of was dry when the shifted character entered play.

#### 8.10.6.
A shifted character retains whatever damage is on the character it’s put on top of.

#### 8.10.7.
When a shifted character leaves play, all cards in its stack move to the same zone as the shifted character card does, and the cards are no longer considered to be in a stack (see 5.1.1.7).

#### 8.10.8.
The Shift keyword has two variants: [Classification] Shift and Universal Shift.  
These variant keywords are Shift abilities and follow all rules for the Shift keyword with the following exceptions.

##### 8.10.8.1.
[Classification] Shift means “If you have a character in play with the [Classification] specified by this ability, you may play this character by paying their Shift cost instead of their ink cost.  
If you do, put this card on top of another character you have in play with the specified classification.”

##### 8.10.8.2.
Universal Shift means “If you have a character in play, you may play this character by paying their Shift cost instead of their ink cost.  
If you do, put this card on top of another character you have in play.”

### 8.11. Singer

#### 8.11.1.
The Singer keyword represents a static ability that allows a player to pay an alternate cost to sing a song.  
Singer N means “This character can ![[imagenes/exert.svg|20]] to pay the alternate cost of a song card as though they had cost N instead of their normal ink cost.”

#### 8.11.2.
This character counts as cost N only to sing songs and only during the process of playing a card.  
The character’s ink cost doesn’t change.

---

### 8.12. Sing Together

#### 8.12.1.
The Sing Together keyword represents a static ability that allows a player to pay an alternate cost to sing a song with one or more of their or their teammates’ characters.  
Sing Together N means “Instead of paying the ink cost of this card, you can {E} a number of your or your teammates’ characters with total ink cost N or greater to play this card without paying its ink cost,” where N is the ink cost of the song.

#### 8.12.2.
When playing a song using Sing Together, add the ink costs of one or more of your ready characters together.  
If the total meets or exceeds the cost listed for Sing Together, the character or characters can sing the song.

#### 8.12.3.
Characters that have the triggered ability condition “Whenever this character sings a song” and are one of the characters singing the song with Sing Together meet the condition, and the triggered ability is added to the bag to resolve.

---

### 8.13. Support

#### 8.13.1.
The Support keyword represents a triggered ability.  
Support means “Whenever this character quests, you may add this character’s {S} to another chosen character’s {S} this turn.”

---

### 8.14. Vanish

#### 8.14.1.
The Vanish keyword represents a triggered ability.  
Vanish means “When this character is chosen by an opponent as part of resolving an action’s effect, banish this character.”

#### 8.14.2.
The Vanish triggered ability resolves after the action’s effect resolves.  
If the character has moved to a different zone before the triggered ability resolves, it resolves with no effect.

---

### 8.15. Ward

#### 8.15.1.
The Ward keyword represents a static ability.  
Ward means “Your opponents can’t choose this card when resolving an effect.”

#### 8.15.2.
Effects that don’t require the player to choose still affect a character with Ward.
